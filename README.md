## A roguelike written in SDL2

This is a functional skeleton for the roguelike I'm working on.
For now, I figured updating it here may provide useful code for anyone else using SDL2.

## Installation

[Visit the SDL2 github to get started](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL).
[Also be sure to install SDL2_Image](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_image)

Or if you're on Debian, simply

> sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
>
> sudo apt install libsdl2-image-dev

## Compiling

Run `build.sh`. The flags <b>NEED</b> to be in the same order they're in within that file.
